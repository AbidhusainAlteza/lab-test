1,CBC Test,,,"Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a blood test that measures Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb), and Hematocrit (Hct) in the blood. This test is used to determine the overall health and screen for any diseases that affect the blood cells.

What is Blood cells, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit?

Blood is composed of cells and necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen needed for the health. The blood cells are produced in bone marrow and are released into the blood. It provides nutrients and helps in the transport of gases within cells and tissues.

The three main types of blood cells are:

Red Blood Cells (RBC):

Red blood cells contain a complex protein called hemoglobin. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs.
White Blood Cells (WBC):

White blood cells also called as leukocytes that help to protect the body against infections and foreign invaders, thus an important part of our immune system.
These cells are originated from bone marrow but circulate throughout the bloodstream.
Platelets (PLTs):

Platelets are the smallest blood cells that help the blood to clot during bleeding.
Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are other two important substances in the blood. Hemoglobin is a complex protein found in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues from the lungs. It also transports carbon dioxide from the body back to the lungs. Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cell found in the whole blood.

Why this test is performed?

This test is performed as part of a routine check-up to monitor the overall health of an individual. Your doctor may ask you to perform this test to diagnose or to screen for diseases and conditions such as anemia, infections, cancer, or any bleeding disorder. This test is also recommended by your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, pale skin, cold hands, and feet, etc. These are some of the common signs and symptoms which may be associated with anemia or polycythemia.

You may be advised to undergo this test if you are pregnant, have a family history of anemia, are suffering from an infection, have had blood loss after surgery, are suffering from heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. This test is also performed to monitor the treatment response in individuals receiving treatment for diseases or conditions that affect blood cells.

How often this test is performed?

If you have a family history of blood disorders or conditions that affect blood cells, your doctor may ask you to perform this test on a 6-monthly basis or a yearly basis. Anemic patients should perform this test on a regular basis, as instructed by the doctor.

Pathology test parameters: Red blood cells (RBC), White blood cells (WBC), Platelets (PLTs), Hemoglobin (Hb) and Hematocrit (Hct).

Also known as CBC Automated Blood, Complete Blood Picture Automated Blood, CBP Automated Blood, Absolute Blood Count Automated Blood, Complete Blood Count, Platelet Test, WBC Test, Absolute Count, CBC, CBP, Complete Count, Complete Picture, Neutrophils Test, Hb PCV Test.",,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your CBC Test. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for CBC Test.

No specific preparation is required for this test. However, follow all the instructions given by your Clinicians.","Generally, there is no need for medical interventions if test results are in normal range.

If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are lower than the normal range, it may indicate different types of anemia such as iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, etc. Some medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), leukemia (a type of blood cancer), chronic kidney disease, internal bleeding due to a stomach ulcer, stomach or colon cancer, etc. may also cause low levels. Deficiency of iron, vitamin B-12, and folic acid; recent blood donations; heavy prolonged menstrual bleeding, etc. may also result in low levels.

If the red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are higher than the normal range, it may indicate a condition called polycythemia, a type of cancer where the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells. Medical conditions such as heart or lung diseases, dehydration, etc. may also result in higher levels.

If the white blood cell count is lower than the normal range, it may indicate autoimmune disorder like lupus and ulcerative colitis, bone marrow problems, or cancer.

If the white blood cell count is higher than the normal range, it may indicate bacterial infections like tuberculosis, viral infections, and fungus. Use of certain medications such as steroids, lithium, and some inhalers may also increase the white blood count.

Lower than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytopenia. This may occur due to medical conditions such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer), aplastic anemia, viral infections, some autoimmune disorders, splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen), cirrhosis of the liver, kidney dysfunction, etc. Other factors such as chemotherapy drugs (cancer medicines); vitamin B12, iron, or folic acid deficiency; chronic alcohol use, etc. may also cause thrombocytopenia.

Higher than the normal levels of platelet count is known as thrombocytosis. Thrombocytosis is categorized as primary or essential thrombocytosis and secondary thrombocytosis. Primary thrombocytosis is an uncommon disorder; it generally occurs in individuals greater than 50 years of age, especially in women. It occurs when your bone marrow produces too many platelets. Secondary thrombocytosis may occur due to an ongoing disease condition, certain infections, cancer, anemia, major surgery or trauma, removal of the spleen, etc. Based on the test results, your doctor may advise appropriate medical treatments, lifestyle modifications, or further diagnostic tests.

1,Dengue Ns1 Antigen Pcr Blood,,,"Dengue virus NS1 test is used to detect dengue in early days (1-2 days) of the fever. This test is used to detect dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen in the acute phase infection of dengue virus. This test is also used to detect secondary dengue virus infection in a shorter duration of time within 1-4 days following the onset of symptoms.

What is Dengue?

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. These mosquitoes bite during day time hence protection from mosquitoes at night by mosquito repellents and nets do not prevent dengue fever. They breed in fresh and clean water and also in tubes, drums, containers, old tyres, and cans. It is mostly found in tropical and subtropical regions of over 100 countries. The incubation period of dengue virus is 4-10 days. There are three types of dengue fever:

Dengue shock syndrome with low blood pressure.
Dengue fever with no serious complications.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever with bleeding problems or low platelet and plasma leakage.
Accurate and timely detection of dengue virus is important for the early diagnosis of dengue fever. This test is used especially for early detection of dengue virus.

Why this test is performed?

This test may be recommended to you if you are suspected of dengue viral attack. The symptoms include fall in body temperature, rapid breathing, bleeding gums or bleeding in other regions, severe abdominal pain, headache, pain behind eyes, increased tiredness, rashes, nausea, headache, and joint pains, etc.",,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Dengue Ns1 Antigen Pcr Blood. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Dengue Ns1 Antigen Pcr Blood.

No specific preparation is required for dengue virus NS1 test.","If your test results show positive results then the dengue NS1 antigen is consistent with acute-phase infection.

If your test results are negative then dengue NS1 antigen is consistent with the lack of acute phase infection. The dengue NS1 test may also be negative if the specimen is collected before 24-48 hours of dengue virus attack.

If you get abnormal test results, consult your doctor immediately. Your doctor may recommend other tests depending on your results.",600,,,,,,,,,1,0,,,
1,Dengue Antibodies IgG ELISA,,,"Dengue antibodies IgG test is used to detect the antibodies which are produced in response to the dengue infection. The presence of IgG antibody is used in diagnosing dengue fever. This test is especially useful in detecting the current or recent infection.

2,HbA1c Test,,,"HbA1c is used to measure the amount of blood sugar (glucose) attached to hemoglobin over 3 months. This combination of hemoglobin and glucose is called HbA1c. Hemoglobin is a component of red blood cells which carry oxygen from the lungs to the whole body. HbA1c test shows the average amount of glucose present in hemoglobin for 3 months. It is usually done once in three months because typically lifespan of a red blood cell is 3 months.

It is used to check for diabetes or prediabetes in adults. Prediabetes indicates that you are at the risk of getting diabetes. If you are already a diabetic patient then it will help you in regulating glucose levels.

Why this test is performed?
This test may be recommended to you by your doctor if you have symptoms of diabetes like blurred vision, increased urination, increased thirst, fatigue. Your doctor may also recommend this test if you are at risk of having diabetes. These symptoms include high blood pressure, history of heart disease, overweight or obese, less physical activity.

Frequency:
If you are diabetic HbA1c test should be done once every three months. But it may be needed more if you are planning to have a baby or your treatment has changed recently or if you have problems controlling your blood sugar levels.

Precautions:
HbA1c test results may be altered by different disease conditions like anemia or other blood disorders like thalassemia, kidney disease, or liver disease. Hence inform your doctor or technician about your current medical conditions and medications, especially vitamin C and vitamin E supplements, atorvastatin. HbA1c test results are also altered by your habits like smoking, opium and substance abuse. Temperature also alters the HbA1c levels, mostly during winter and cold conditions there may be chances of the high level of HbA1c.

The HbA1c test is not recommended for gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that affects only pregnant women. It is also not recommended for diagnosing diabetes in children.

2,Insulin Fasting,,,"Insulin Fasting is a test that measures insulin levels in the blood after 8 hours of fasting or whole night fasting.

What is Insulin?

Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin helps in absorption of glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream into the cells of the body. In these cells, glucose is used for the production of energy, which is utilized by the body. In healthy individuals, insulin production is high when the glucose levels in the blood are high and insulin production is low when the glucose levels in the blood are low.

Insulin maintains blood glucose levels and prevents hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels) as well as hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels). Insulin converts the excess sugar in the blood into glycogen for storage.

If insulin secretion is abnormal or if the body is unable to produce insulin, it may lead to an increase in the blood sugar levels; this may cause Diabetes mellitus. If the body is unable to produce insulin, it may lead to type 1 diabetes mellitus. If the body produces an insufficient amount of insulin or if the body cells are resistant to insulin, this may lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Why this test is performed?

Your doctor may ask you to perform this test if you are suffering from symptoms such as frequent urination, hunger, blurred vision, fatigue, increased thirst or dry mouth, unexplained weight loss or weight gain, poor wound healing, foot pain and numbness, frequent infections, itching around penis or vagina, sweating, fast heart rate, sleepiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, etc. which are common symptoms of diabetes mellitus. In some cases, such as the removal of an insulinoma (a tumor of the pancreas), your doctor may ask you to perform this test to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. This test may be performed either alone or in a combination with other tests for better diagnosis.

This test is also done to understand whether an individual is having pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), Cushing syndrome (pink and purple stretch marks along with round face and large tummy), acromegaly (enlargement of the face, hand, and feet), insulinomas (excess production of insulin due to tumor in the pancreas). If the patient exhibits symptoms of diabetes, the doctor may ask the patient to undergo insulin fasting test to determine the status of insulin secretion.

Precautions:

Medications such as corticosteroids, levodopa, oral contraceptives, etc. may alter the results of this test. Hence, it is advised that you report all your current medications to your healthcare practitioner before undergoing this test.

Frequency:

The frequency of this test depends on various factors like suspected diabetes mellitus, personal history of diabetes, family history of diabetes, body weight, history of heart disease, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes (high blood sugar levels during pregnancy), imbalance of female sex hormones, polycystic ovary disease, etc.",Insulin Fasting Blood,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Insulin Fasting. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Insulin Fasting.

Fasting Insulin test is done after you have fasted (without eating or drinking anything) for a whole night or for 8 to 12 hours. Usually, the blood is drawn in the morning after an overnight fast.","If the test result falls within the normal reference range, then the insulin production is normal and you may not need further medical intervention.

Increased levels of insulin may be due to obesity, insulinoma, type-2 diabetes mellitus, infantile hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinism (increase in the insulin levels than the normal range), Cushing's syndrome (pink and purple stretch marks along with round face and large tummy), acromegaly (enlargement of the face, hand, and feet), hyperthyroidism (excess production of hormones from thyroid gland), insulin resistance, etc.

Decreased levels of insulin may indicate hypopituitarism (decrease in hormone production by the pituitary gland), Type-1 diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis (inflammation in the pancreas), pancreatic cancer, etc.",810,,,,,,,,,1,0,,,
2,Fasting Blood Sugar,,,"A fasting blood sugar (FBS) test is used to measure the amount of glucose (sugar) present in your blood after fasting for a whole night or for 8 hours. This test is used to monitor individuals with diabetes. Fasting blood sugar test is the most commonly prescribed test for diabetes and it is the simplest and fastest test.

What is the importance of glucose?
The main source of energy for all the cells in our body, mostly for brain cells comes from glucose. Glucose acts as a building block for carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are commonly found in rice, cereals, bread, fruit, or pasta. Carbohydrates are immediately converted to glucose, thus increasing the glucose levels in your blood. This condition is called diabetes.

Why this test is performed?
This test may be recommended to you if you experience any of the symptoms like increase urge to urinate, blurred vision, recent weight gain, confusion, change in behavior, if you experience seizures for the first time, loss of consciousness, etc. Increase in your blood sugar levels and diabetes may not always show all the symptoms.

Precautions:
Some medicines may also alter your fasting blood sugar levels like contraceptive pills, diuretics like furosemide, torsemide, etc, if you are on hormone therapy, corticosteroids like prednisone, prednisolone, etc, aspirin, phenytoin, lithium, epinephrine, sulfonylurea drugs like glimepiride, glipizide etc, tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline, etc.

Inform your doctor about your past illness or medications, about your present illness and current medication prior to the test.

Frequency:
For individuals above 45 years of age, this test is recommended every 3 years. The frequency of this test depends on various factors like body weight, history of heart disease, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, imbalance of female sex hormones, a family member with diabetes, physically inactive, polycystic ovary disease, etc. Children above 10 years of age with any of two above-mentioned risk factors should be recommended to this test at least once in every 3 years even with no symptoms.

Also known as FBS, Glucose Fasting, Sugar Fasting.",Glucose Fasting Blood,"Inform your doctor if you are on any medications, have any allergies or underlying medical conditions before your Fasting Blood Sugar. Your doctor will give specific instructions depending on your condition on how to prepare for Fasting Blood Sugar.

Fasting blood sugar test is done after you fasted (without eating anything) for a whole night or for 8 to 12 hours. Usually, the blood is drawn in the morning after overnight fasting.","If your fasting blood sugar levels are slightly higher than your normal levels, it may indicate impaired fasting blood glucose which is a type of prediabetes. If it is greater than normal range then it may indicate that you have diabetes.

If your fasting blood sugar levels are lower than normal range then it may indicate a condition called hypoglycemia.

Sometimes other medical problems may also lead to high blood sugar levels like pancreatic cancer, overactive thyroid gland, pancreatitis where pancreas are swollen, stress, trauma, stroke, heart attack, surgery, acromegaly, glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma, Cushing syndrome, etc.

Low level fasting blood sugar may be due to pituitary gland disorder like hypopituitarism, too little food, too much insulin or diabetic medicines, liver disease or kidney disease, underactive adrenal gland or thyroid gland, vigorous exercise, weight loss post surgery, tumor in the pancreas, etc.",70,,,,,,,,,1,0,,,
